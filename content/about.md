This is the about page
Thanks for dropping by my page on interwebs.

For those of you that know me know about my passion for all things
technology. I love to read about technolgy and thanks to my long bus
rides to work and back I get plenty of time to indulge. I love to share
my knowledge with friends and family. We are living in the golden age of
tech where we are on the cusp of a major leap that will propel humankind
into an age wehre machines and humans will live interdependant lives.
Virtual and Augmented reality will open up new experiences for all.
Food tech will feed the billions that today have to go to bed hungry. A
world where disease will be combated with individualized medicines at a
reasonable cost. Gene therapies coded with your dna will target disease
and cause less side effects. Quantum computing will enbale computing on
a scale that we cannot currently fathom. 

to learn about the future of tech tune in and drop by .
