### Pokemon Go
<https://goo.gl/hTaCD3>

Incase you have not noticed Pokemon mania  is upon us. Every person you
encounter walking while looking into their phone is playing the game.
Walking on NYC streets, no buses trains and restaurants that I visit
Pokemon are everywhere and so are the players. I am glad that this has
gotten my kids off the couch and exploring our neighborhood looking for
Pokemon.  Although 20 years in the making Pokemon is best suited to the
Augmented reality experience and the game developers Niantic have done a
decent job with it. Gotta Catch em all !

### Six basic Arcs of story telling
<https://goo.gl/iOMJhW>

Word sentiment analysis  data mining of over 1700 stories has shown they
fall into 6 basic arcs. Vonnegut spoke about graphical shapes of stories
in a lecture in 1995 and Aristotle spoke about similar arcs 2000 years
ago. Its good to see that data mining is lending its voice to these
theories. 

### Bitcoin Miner reward is cut in half

The reward miners get for sealing a block on the bitcoin ledger drops
from 25 btc to 12.5 btc .Known as "the halving" this has been programmed
feature  in bitcoin. This is only the second time that this has
happened. Would be interesting to keep an eye on the bitcoin price for
the next few weeks.

### Deep Learning to colorize your photos

A deep learning algorithm developed by UC Berekley students is doing a
decent job at colorizing photos. 

### VCs are betting on a chinese fitness boom

365 million chinese  millenials are hitting the gym and VCs are taking
note. I suspect Apple and Fitbit have their eyes on this one too.
