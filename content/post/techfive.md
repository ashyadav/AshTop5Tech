The machines are winning. The recent win of Google's Deepmind AI at laying Go is a major step in Machine Learning.  Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game has long been the holy grail of the AI geeks to find. Recently  Google's DeepMind AI defeated Go Grandmaster Lee Se Dol 4-1.  This is clearly a triumph of the advances in artificial Intelligence and deep learning.  In Game 3 Deepmind played a move that no human has ever made. Here in lies the hope that AI will bring to humanity. It will enable us to see things that we have not yet dreamt of and help us look beyond our imagination. So heres looking to the beginning of a beautiful friendship humanity+ai
