Thanks for dropping by my page on interwebs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that know me know about my passion for all things
technology. I love to read about technolgy and thanks to my long bus
rides to work and back I get plenty of time to indulge. I love to share
my knowledge with friends and family. We are living in the golden age of
tech where we are on the cusp of a major leap that will propel humankind
into an age wehre machines and humans will live interdependant lives.
Virtual and Augmented reality will open up new experiences for all.
Food tech will feed the billions that today have to go to bed hungry. A
world where disease will be combated with individualized medicines at a
reasonable cost. Gene therapies coded with your dna will target disease
and cause less side effects. Quantum computing will enbale computing on
a scale that we cannot currently fathom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to learn about the future of tech tune in and drop by .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokemon Go, Story Arcs, Bitcoin Halving,  AI photo coloring, China
Fitness Boom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pokemon-go:f8794d860ed3d63f86a7352ab3d4dc48&#34;&gt;Pokemon Go&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/hTaCD3&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/hTaCD3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokemon Go mania  is upon us. Almost every person you
encounter walking while looking into their phone is playing the game.
Walking on NYC streets, on buses and restaurants that I visit
Pokemons, poke-stops and poke-gyms are everywhere . I am glad that this
game has got kids off the couch and exploring neighborhoods looking for
Pokemon.  Although 20 years in the making Pokemon is best suited to the
Augmented reality experience and the game developers Niantic have done a
very good job with it. This week it became the most downloaded app in a
week on the ios app store. Gotta Catch em all !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;six-basic-arcs-of-story-telling:f8794d860ed3d63f86a7352ab3d4dc48&#34;&gt;Six basic Arcs of story telling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/iOMJhW&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/iOMJhW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word sentiment analysis  data mining of over 1700 stories has shown that they
fall into 6 basic arcs. Vonnegut spoke about graphical shapes of stories
in a lecture in 1995 and Aristotle spoke about similar arcs 2000 years
ago. Its good to see that data mining is lending its voice to these
theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bitcoin-miner-reward-is-cut-in-half:f8794d860ed3d63f86a7352ab3d4dc48&#34;&gt;Bitcoin Miner reward is cut in half&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/Srdihi&#34;&gt;http://goo.gl/Srdihi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reward miners get for sealing a block on the bitcoin ledger drops
from 25 btc to 12.5 btc .Known as &amp;ldquo;the halving&amp;rdquo; this has been  a programmed
feature  in bitcoin. It is only the second time that this has
happened. It will  be interesting to keep an eye on the bitcoin price for
the next few weeks to see the impact if any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;deep-learning-to-colorize-your-photos:f8794d860ed3d63f86a7352ab3d4dc48&#34;&gt;Deep Learning to colorize your photos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/MNOlPU&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/MNOlPU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deep learning algorithm developed by UC Berekley students is doing a
decent job at colorizing photos. Click the link above to see some
stunning results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vcs-are-betting-on-a-chinese-fitness-boom:f8794d860ed3d63f86a7352ab3d4dc48&#34;&gt;VCs are betting on a chinese fitness boom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/E1MkcI&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/E1MkcI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;365 million chinese  millenials are hitting the gym and VCs are taking
note. I suspect Apple and Fitbit have their eyes on this mega market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SWIFT, Eye Computer, VIV, Bitcoin, Parsey McPareface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;another-swift-attack:b2b61fc48fbebe9d570f15a2a61d96bd&#34;&gt;Another SWIFT Attack&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/n3pPaH&#34;&gt;http://goo.gl/n3pPaH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SWIFT interbank network that  handles money transfers between bank has seen its second major hack attack.  SWIFT is the primary way banks move billions of dollars to other banks daily. The hack spreads malware using a pdf reader software and bears code signatures similar to the Sony hack and the recent attack on the Bangladesh Central Bank. So if you work at a bank and are reading swift message via a pdf reader make sure its not infected and stay vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-computer-in-your-eye:b2b61fc48fbebe9d570f15a2a61d96bd&#34;&gt;A computer in your eye&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/5ZHy4G&#34;&gt;http://goo.gl/5ZHy4G&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google glass was a stepping stone to the next gen devices google is dreaming up. Not content with the public rejection of google glass the company continues to push the envelope on a wearable computer. It latest vision via a patent filing is to implant one directly into your eyeball.  Once injected the device would be powered by an energy harvesting antenna. The device can transmit  signals like GPS, NFC, LTE. Will it be able to interact with the optic nerve and beam signals directly to the neo cortex is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;viv-conversation-as-a-platform-caap:b2b61fc48fbebe9d570f15a2a61d96bd&#34;&gt;Viv - Conversation as a platform CAAP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/wDLp5H&#34;&gt;http://goo.gl/wDLp5H&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new conversational bot named Viv was unveiled  last week by the creators of Siri. Viv promises to be the bridge between the apps on your device. You could ask Viv to order some flowers for mom or the temperature at the golden gate bridge at 7pm. You could even ask it to send some money to your friends. The AI assistant would be social graph and service aware to make the autonomous decisions for you. Will Viv be a radical change or just another bot that is gobbled up  by Siri, Cortana or Ok Google&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-the-real-satoshi-nakamato-please-stand-up:b2b61fc48fbebe9d570f15a2a61d96bd&#34;&gt;Will the real Satoshi Nakamato please stand up &amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/kCy4Vh&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/kCy4Vh&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elusive founder of bitcoin  was found and lost again. Australian Craig Steve Wright was briefly unmasked as the infamous  Satoshi Nakamoto, founder of bitcoin. Several clues including a PGP pubic key, blog posts and the mysterious &amp;ldquo;Tulip Trust&amp;rdquo; .  Clues that surfaced after the release of the Wired story point an elaborate hoax that Wright may be propagating. So once more Nakamoto-san slips back into matrix..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause I&amp;rsquo;m Slim Shady, yes I&amp;rsquo;m the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won&amp;rsquo;t the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up, please stand up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;parsey-mcparseface:b2b61fc48fbebe9d570f15a2a61d96bd&#34;&gt;Parsey McParseface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/dxd3ih&#34;&gt;http://goo.gl/dxd3ih&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google this week open sourced its natural language parser. This will enable smarter applications that one can communicate with using natural language. This should make chatbots smarter. The parser SyntaxNet is a Neural network built on googles macdhine learning framework Tensor Flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go - Deepmind, Skinterface, Email Habits, Doodling, HoverBike&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ai-thoughts-on-deepmind-and-go:4e4768de6f4135f2744c796a1d565640&#34;&gt;AI - Thoughts on Deepmind and Go&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#AI #go #deepmind #singularity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machines are winning. The recent win of Google&amp;rsquo;s Deepmind AI at laying Go is a major step in Machine Learning.  Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game has long been the holy grail of the AI geeks to find. Recently  Google&amp;rsquo;s DeepMind AI defeated Go Grandmaster Lee Se Dol 4-1.  This is clearly a triumph of the advances in artificial Intelligence and deep learning.  In Game 3 Deepmind played a move that no human has ever made. Here in lies the hope that AI will bring to humanity. It will enable us to see things that we have not yet dreamt of and help us look beyond our imagination. So heres looking to the beginning of a beautiful friendship humanity+ai&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;skinterface:4e4768de6f4135f2744c796a1d565640&#34;&gt;Skinterface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#interface #applewatch #smartwatch #androidwear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new idea for using the human skin as input for our smartwatch may just be the thing that will make them more usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/OaJxAK&#34;&gt;Video Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;email-habits:4e4768de6f4135f2744c796a1d565640&#34;&gt;Email habits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#email&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great tips from the C-suite on dealing with your daily email deluge.

&lt;h4 id=&#34;doodling:4e4768de6f4135f2744c796a1d565640&#34;&gt;Doodling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#art #doodle
As a parent of a doodler I was fascinated to learn how doodling enhances memory, recall and understanding of the subject matter. Maybe that is why when whiteboard my meetings I enjoy them better .
